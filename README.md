### Laboratory Assignment  
1. Generate and plot the elementary signals in DSP (Impulse, unit impulse, ramp, Exponential, and sinusoid signals).  
[Solution](1.%20Elementary%20signals%20in%20DSP.ipynb)
2. Compute the linear convolution of two signals (Eqn. 2.3.17).
3. Compute the cross-correlation sequence of two signals x(n) and h(n). [Hint: 2.6.1]
4. Determine the autocorrelation sequence of the signal x(n). [Hint: 2.6.1]
5. Determine and plot the Fourier series of DT periodic signal. [Eqn. 4.2.7 and 4.2.8]
6. Compute Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal using DFT equation.
7. Compute inverse DFT of the signal obtained in (6). Cross check your results with Matlab/
Python library functions.
8. By means of the DFT and IDFT, determine the response of the FIR filter with impulse
response h(n) to the input sequence x(n). [Hint: Ex. 7.3.1]
9. Compute the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) using divide and conquer approach (e.g N=2 x
N/2).
10. Compute the FFT of a given signal with N = 8 using Radix-2 algorithm
